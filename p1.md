# `Program 1`

A library service wants to create a database to store details of its libraries, books and borrowers. Details include the following:
A book has a unique ISBN number, a title and one or more authors. The library service may own several copies of a given book, each of which is located in one of the service's libraries. A given library contains many books, and in order to distinguish different copies of the same book a library assigns a different copy number to each of its copies of a given book, the price that was paid for each copy is also recorded. Every library may have zero or more branch libraries and every branch library is a branch of exactly one main library. A borrower has a name and  a unique ID code. A borrower can have many books on loan, but each copy of a book can only be on loan to one borrower. A borrower could borrow the same book on several occassions, but it is assumed that each such loan will take place on a different date.

Draw ER/EER diagram for the above requirement.
