# `Program 2`

A record company wishes to use a computer database to help with its operations regarding its performers, recordings and song catalogue. A requirements analysis has elicited the following information: Songs have a unique song number, a non-unique title and a composition date. A song can be written by a number of composers; the composer's full name is required. Songs are recorded by recording artists (bands or solo performers). A song is recorded as a track of a CD. A CD has many songs on it, called tracks. CDs have a unique record catalogue number, a title and must have a producer (the full name of the producer is required). Each track must have the recording date and the track number of the CD. A song can appear on many (or no) CDs, and be recorded by many different recording artists. The same recording artist might re-record the same song on different CDs. A CD must have only I recording artist appearing on it. CDs can be released a number of times, and each time the release date and associated number of sales is required. 

Use this information to design an appropriate ER/EER model.
